# Purpose
I will be documanting my smarthome with raspeberry pi school project here.
I'm well aware of setups like Home Assistant, but the implementation of a premade set up is not the point of this assignement.

## Tools & Equipment
* Raspberry Pi:
	* Power cabel
	* Ethernet cabel
	* SD Card
* Smarthome devices:
	* TPLink HS110 Smartplugs
	* Smart TV (Coming soon)
* Sensors:
	* DS18B20 temperature sensor
	* Motionsensor (Coming soon)
* Smartphone
* Other:
	* USB webcamera
## Software
* NodeRed
	I decided to go with NodeRed since it's a beginner friendly way to create custom home automation, smarthome features and the ease of adding new nodes and features.
* Telegram
	The closest thing to hasselfree and somewhat safe method of communication between NodeRed and authorized users.
* fswebcam
	Easiest solution to using a USB webcamera on a Pi.
